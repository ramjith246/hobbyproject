<div class="intro">
<p class="intrtxt">Gibberish, also called jibber-jabber or gobbledygook, is English speech that is (or appears to be) nonsense. It may include speech sounds that are not actual words,[1] or language games and specialized jargon that seems nonsensical to outsiders.[2]

"Gibberish" is also used as an imprecation to denigrate or tar ideas or opinions the user disagrees with or finds irksome, a rough equivalent of "nonsense", "folderol", or "claptrap". The implication is that the criticized expression or proposition lacks substance or congruence, as opposed to simply being a differing view.

The related word jibber-jabber refers to rapid talk that is difficult to understand.[3]</p>
